<p style="margin-top: 100px">Looking back, there are a number of different events in my life which triggered me to choose building a startup, and there have been many different people along the way who have encouraged me and kept me motivated.</p>

I love to be in touch with aspiring startup founders and students considering taking the path of creating a startup instead of doing further education or looking for a job.

I generally speak about the following topics:

- lean startup
- customer development
- building traction through content marketing
- choosing a co-founder
- raising investment
- hiring
- personal development
